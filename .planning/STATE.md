# STATE.md — GateWise Mobile UI Migration

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-13)

**Core value:** Every screen must faithfully reproduce the Stitch "Gunmetal + Aqua" design system.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Auth Flow & Root Routing

## Current Status

**Active Phase:** 1 — Auth Flow & Root Routing
**Overall Progress:** 0 of 5 phases complete

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status |

| 3 | Guard "ShieldGuard" App (4 Tabs + Settings) | 🔲 Not started |
| 4 | Service Staff App (3 Tabs) | 🔲 Not started |
| 5 | Shared Component Polish & QA | 🔲 Not started |

## Existing Work (Carry Forward)

The following was partially completed before GSD initialization:

- `mobile/app/_layout.tsx` — font loading + global CSS configured
- `mobile/tailwind.config.js` — Gunmetal design tokens
- `mobile/metro.config.js` + `mobile/babel.config.js` — NativeWind v4 configured
- `mobile/global.css` — Tailwind directives
- `mobile/components/ui/Text.tsx` — typography primitive
- `mobile/components/ui/Button.tsx` — button primitive (glass/outline/ghost variants)
- `mobile/components/ui/Card.tsx` — glassmorphism card primitive
- `mobile/components/ui/Icon.tsx` — MaterialIcons wrapper
- `mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — partial Resident Home (will be replaced in Phase 2)
- `mobile/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — old tab layout (will be replaced in Phase 1)

## Session Notes

- User design source: 12+ Stitch HTML templates (Gunmetal + Aqua design system)
- Design requirement: pixel-faithful reproduction — glassmorphism, blur nav, Inter typography
- Auth: mock only (no backend calls this milestone)
- Icons: MaterialIcons from `@expo/vector-icons` (matches Stitch HTML Material Symbols)
- NativeWind v4 configured and working
- Font loading (Inter via `@expo-google-fonts/inter`) previously fixed
